# Stochastic Sampling

This program analyzes a large body of text based on the word frequency. The program returns random words or sentences based on frequency. This is the fourth step of an NLP Tweet Generator project I'm working on.

## Quick Start

1. Run ```python stochastic.py 'holmes.txt'``` to pass the ```holmes.txt``` file in the ```stochastic.py``` function.
1. The function returns a word from the file based on it's frequency.

1. ```stochastic.py``` utilizes the ```histogram.py``` function.
